# Pixel Force Challenge

This project was created as part of the Pixel Force challenge, with the goal of building an interactive web application using modern web technologies. This is my result after dedicating 2 hours to the challenge.

Onboarding with Hardcoded Images: Due to CORS restrictions, the responses from the image API were temporarily hardcoded in the onboarding component.

Technologies Used
- React: The project was built using React for a dynamic and easy-to-maintain user interface.
- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS was used for quick and efficient styling, enabling agile development.

This project was generated with React version 17.0.1.

### Known Limitations
Due to CORS issues, responses from the image API have been temporarily hardcoded in the onboarding component. This was done to facilitate the demonstration of the project in the development environment.
